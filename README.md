# Markov-Decision-Process-Algorithms
Classical Markov Decision Process algorithms using an MDP data structure and also presenting the GUBS criterion algorithm that establishes a new trade-off between cost and probability

When doing my scientific research: "Efficient algorithms to Markov Decision Processes based on the GUBS optimality criterion", which is about a new more efficient algorithm to GUBS criterion that do a different trade-off between cost and probability to achieve the goal I developed an MDP data structure and reproduced some classical algorithms like Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, LAO* that work with this data structure.
